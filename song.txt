She just walked away.
Why didn't she tell me
And where do I go tonight
This isn't happening to me
This can't be happening to me
She didn't say a word
Just walked away
You were the first to say
That we were not ok
You were the first to lie
When we were not alright
This was my first love
She was the first to go
And when she left me for you
I was the last to know
Why didn't she tell me
Where to go tonight
She didn't say a word
She just walked away
